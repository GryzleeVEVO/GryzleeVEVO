## About me

Born in Poland and raised in Spain, I've been interested in technology, computers, and STEM in general since my childhood years, always tinkering with what I had available and trying to help the less computer-savvy people around me. 

Currently, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Zaragoza.

Most of my experience comes from programming in **C/C++**.

I'm highly familiar with the **Linux** and **Unix** environment, and use Linux as a daily driver.
