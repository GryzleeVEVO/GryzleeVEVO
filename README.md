## About me

Currently, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Zaragoza. My studies have revolved around algorithms, AI, and language parsers. However, I'm also passionate about creating and managing systems, networking, and backends for web applications.

Most of my experience comes from programming in **C** and **C++**. 

I've used C++ extensively for implementing high-performance programs as well as a learning tool for algorithms and data structures. On the other hand, C has been fundamental for learning systems programming and embedded software on devices such as ARM microcontrollers.

Both programming languages have given me insight on how software really works at the lowest level.

I'm highly familiar with the **Linux** and **Unix** environment, and currently use Linux as a daily driver for developement.

Additionaly, I've become familiar with shell scripting with **Bash**, being the tool of choice for tasks such as for build scripts, simple text processing, or the ocassional quick and dirry hack.

I've ocasionally used the **Java** ecosystem for developement.

On the one hand, I've used Java for previous projects such as a simple compiler using the JavaCC parser, and an Android app.

On the other hand, I used **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot** for the backend of a URL shortening service.
